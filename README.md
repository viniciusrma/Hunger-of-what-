## 📑 About

Welcome! 

This is a website called “Hunger of what?!”, for searching for food and/or restaurants, based in React, in my very first project done in React and prototyped by myself.

In total, there are four parts on this project:

- Creating Static Components ✅

A user can:
- search for restaurants, in any location;
