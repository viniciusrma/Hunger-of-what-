## 📑 About

Welcome! 

This is a website called “Hunger of what?!”, for searching for food nor restaurants, made with React, in my very first react project by myself.

In total, there will be four parts to this project:

- Creating Static Components
- Passing Information to Components
- Setting the State of Ravenous Components
- Interacting with the Yelp API

Here’s a quick overview of how Hunger Of What?! should function:

A user will be ablt to:
- be able search for restaurants, in any location;
- be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API;
- be able to sort through restaurants using a filter.
